          <p>Welcome to the Faculty of Applied Science and Technology (FAST) of the Dzodze Institute of Technology. In January 2023, Council of the DIT on the recommendation of the Academic Board authorized the establishment of an Faculty of Applied Science and Technology.
             This followed the report and recommendations of the Vice Chancellorâ€™s Committee on the Creation of an Faculty to enhance the transfer of knowledge, technology and innovation from University research to meet the needs of industry. 
             The committee which was chaired by Professor Ivan Addae-Mensah also recommended that FAST be a multidisciplinary Faculty bringing together researchers from the entire university.</p>
            <p>The Committee further recommended that the programmes of the Faculty should be industry-led through the establishment of an Advisory Board with strong representation from Ghanaian industry. 
            The governance structures of the Institute which include the Advisory Board and Management Committee are expected to ensure that this is done.
            Administratively, the Faculty sits in the College of Basic and Applied Sciences which is an amalgamation of the previous Faculties of Science, Engineering Sciences and School of Agriculture and their associated research institutes namely the Institute of Environment and Sanitation Studies and the Institute of Agricultural Research.</p>
